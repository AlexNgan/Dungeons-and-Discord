# Dungeons-and-Discord
Code for a bot to help run DnD campaigns on a Discord server. The bot is able to roll dice, with the number of sides specified by the input. The character rolling can also be specified as to apply modifiers to the outcome automatically.

Commands:
- roll
- clear

Roles on server (in order of bot hierarchy):
- Owner and Bot Wrangler
- DM
- Boss
- Nerd
- Member
These are set in permissions.js and correspond to the roles on the Discord server this bot is optimized for.
